* 2005, I learned from Dr. Arthur Mariano, in a course at Univ. of Miami, the concept on how to apply the EOF analysis in a dataset with gaps;
* 2006, Dr. Dudley Chelton introduced me to the complex form of the EOF, suggesting for my research on that time, and gave me his class notes.
* I developed a series of functions for my PhD to estimate the [C]EOF using pyclimate, which were also able to create different plots and to apply an [C]EOF filter.
